Code Formatting

The code in this project follows a specific code formatting style to maintain consistency and readability. Please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to the codebase:

Indentation: 

Use 2 spaces for indentation.
Line Length: Limit each line to a maximum of 80 characters to ensure code readability.
Operator Spacing: Add a space between operators and operands to improve code clarity.
To automate the code formatting process, we recommend using ESLint with the JavaScript Standard Style configuration. Before committing any changes, make sure to run ESLint to ensure the code meets the formatting requirements.

Naming Conventions

Consistent and meaningful naming conventions make the code easier to understand. In this project, we follow these naming conventions:

Variables and Functions: 

Use camelCase for variable and function names. 
Choose descriptive names that accurately represent their purpose.
Classes: Use PascalCase for class names to differentiate them from variables and functions.
Constants: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants, which are typically declared using the const keyword.
By adhering to these naming conventions, we can maintain code consistency and improve code comprehension.

Comments and Documentation

Comments and documentation play a crucial role in understanding the codebase. Here's how we approach comments and documentation in this project:

Inline Comments: 

Use inline comments sparingly and focus on explaining complex or non-obvious code blocks.
Function Documentation: Document functions using JSDoc format. 
Include clear descriptions of parameters, return values, and any important details.
We encourage comprehensive comments and documentation to facilitate code understanding and maintainability.

Best Practices and Design Patterns

To ensure code quality and maintainable architecture, we follow these best practices and design patterns in this project:

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid code duplication and strive for reusable code blocks to minimize redundancy.
SOLID Principles: Adhere to SOLID principles to enhance code maintainability, extensibility, and testability.
MVC Architecture: Our project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate concerns and promote a modular code structure.
By following these best practices and design patterns, we aim to create a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
